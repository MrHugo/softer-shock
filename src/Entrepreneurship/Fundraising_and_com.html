      We decided to find several sponsors and partnerships to help us raise money. We had several meeting with companies such as Syngenta, Agrauxine (Groupe Lesafre), the French wine institute etc. During which we presented our project and the concept we will do if they help us financially. There area some companies that gave us a financial aid. We implemented a communication strategy to advertise our project, one of them being our crowdfunding. We wrote an article in a wine magazine (Viti)and we intervened in a radio programme about vineyards' protection. We talked to many experts to make sure our project would be accepted by the society. As it is important for our project's development to know our potential buyers, we interviewed several winemakers in France, Spain and Mexico. This enabled us to find the best balance between what they want and what we can do in the laboratory.

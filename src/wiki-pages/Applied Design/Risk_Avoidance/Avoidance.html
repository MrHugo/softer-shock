            <p><b>Overview</b>:</p>
            <p>Biosafety occupies a large part of our project. Indeed, the microorganisms that are contained in our solution Softer Shock are intended to be spread in the environment. Since it is a major concern here in France, we decided first to understand why, but mainly to find the best solution for our case.</p>
          </div>
          <h2>Context</h2>
          <hr>
            <p>
              If engineered microorganisms are highly regulated, it is for many different reasons, as their
              spreading would cause a possible biodiversity imbalance and a species competition because
              of the bacteria presence in the environment, an increase of antibiotic resistance because of
              a genetic material transfer or even hygiene issues in the worst case. Also, this regulation
              primarily exists because of ethical questions, which is the main genetically engineered
              microorganisms issue. Although our microorganisms do not carry any real toxic compound,
              we chose to develop the project’s biosafety at its maximum<sup>1,2,4</sup>.</br>
              To do so, in the biosafety aspects of Softer Shock, we chose to create a <b>four walls fortress</b>,
              which means a <b>multi-layer strategy</b>.
            </p>

            <hr>
              <p>Our first wall is the <b>auxotrophy</b>, and we aim at engineering our bacteria so that they
                become dependent to a specific component : it is also called nutritional isolation.
                Here, we chose to make them <b>depend to a 21st amino acid</b>, which is not found in
                nature. Unless it has an access to this synthetic amino acid, <b>the bacterium dies</b> : it
                is confined in the area where the amino acid is spread.<sup>2,3,6</sup></li>

                <figcaption>Figure 2: Synthetic Auxotrophy</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <hr>
              <p>Our second wall is composed of a <b>killswitch</b>, to kill bacteria under certain inputs. It permits the avoidance of a microorganisms spreading. We chose to use the <b>protegrin-1</b>, which causes a <b>membrane poration</b> and so the <b>cell death</b>. Once its sequence is included in our bacteria genetic code with an arabinose operon, it would be activated in the presence of <b>arabinose</b>, making it easy for the farmers to kill the bacteria after harvesting<sup>2</sup>.<br></br>
              We also thought of adding a <b>DNAse coding sequence in our plasmid and an “anti-DNAse”</b> coding sequence in the genomic DNA of our microorganism. If a DNA transfer occurs between a modified and a wild type bacteria, the wild type bacteria which does not contain any anti-DNAse would die<sup>5</sup>.</br>
              With the same idea, RNase/anti-RNase couple can be used. For instance the couple Barnase/Barstar (toxin/inhibitor), from <i>Bacillus amyloliquefaciens</i> is a good candidate for this function<sup>12</sup>.

            <hr>
              <p>For our third wall, we are actively looking for the most adapted chassis and we
                already have some tracks of naturally present bacteria on vine leaves and specific to
                the leaf environment. However, the perfect chassis does not exist, as if it
                extremely specific to the grapevines (so little present) a mass spraying could alter the
                biodiversity and on the contrary, if it is less specific the safety level would be
                lowered<sup>9,10,11</sup>.</p>

            <hr>
              <p>Our last wall is the <b>physical containment</b>. We decided to use the <b>tunnel sprayer</b> (see figure 5), in
                order to diffuse our product and to add some <b>adjuvants</b> to facilitate its use. This
                device is based on a “face to face” model in which each of the product dispenser face
                each other. It seems to be a good choice because the product that is sprayed on one
                side and doesn't end up on the plant is harvested by the panel on the other side.
                Also, it permits the deposit of the spray on both surfaces of leaves. The adjuvants
                would be a <b>drift limitant</b>, a <b>bounce and shatter minimiser</b> and a <b>sticker and
                retention aid</b><sup>7,8</sup>.

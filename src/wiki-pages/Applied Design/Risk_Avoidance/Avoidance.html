          Biosafety occupies a large part of our project. Indeed, the microorganisms that are contained
          in our solution Softer Shock are intended to be spread in the environment. Since it is a major
          concern here in France, we decided first to understand why, but mainly to find the best solution for our case.
        </div>
        <p>
          If engineered microorganisms are highly regulated, it is for many different reason, as their
          spreading would cause a possible biodiversity imbalance and a species competition because
          of the bacteria presence in the environment, an increase of antibiotic resistance because of
          a genetic material transfer or even hygiene issues in the worst case. Also, this regulation
          primarily exists because of ethical questions, which is the main genetically engineered
          microorganisms issue. Although our microorganisms do not carry any real toxic compound,
          we chose to develop the project’s biosafety at its maximum<sup>1,2,4</sup>.<br>
          To do so, in the biosafety aspects of Softer Shock, we chose to create a <span class="blue-text">four walls fortress</span>,
          which means a <span class="blue-text">multi-layer strategy</span>.

          <li>Our first wall is the <span class="blue-text">auxotrophy</span>, and we aim at engineering our bacteria so that they
            become dependent to a specific component : it is also called nutritional isolation.
            Here, we chose to make them <span class="blue-text">depend to a 21st amino acid</span>, which is not found in
            nature. Unless it has an access to this synthetic amino acid, <span class="blue-text">the bacterium dies</span> : it
            is confined in the area where the amino acid is spread.<sup>2,3,6</sup></li>

              Our second wall is composed of a <span class="blue-text">killswitch</span>, to kill bacteria under certain inputs.
              It permits the avoidance of a microorganisms spreading. We chose to use the <span class="blue-text">protegrin-1</span>,
              which causes a <span class="blue-text">membrane poration</span> and so the <span class="blue-text">cell death</span>. Once its sequence is
              included in our bacteria genetic code with an arabinose operon, it would be activated in the
              presence of <span class="blue-text">arabinose</span>, making it easy for the farmers to kill the bacteria after
              harvesting<sup>2</sup>.
              <br>
              <br>
              We also thought of adding a <span class="blue-text">DNAse coding sequence in our plasmid and an “anti-DNAse”</span>
              coding sequence in the genomic DNA of our microorganism. If a DNA transfer occurs between a
              modified and a wild type bacteria, the wild type bacteria which does not contain any anti-DNAse
              would die<sup>5</sup>.

            <li>For our third wall, we are actively looking for the <sup>most adapted chassis</sup> and we
              already have some tracks of naturally present bacteria on vine leaves and specific to
              the leaf environment. However, the perfect chassis does not exist, as if it
              extremely specific to the grapevines (so little present) a mass spraying could alter the
              biodiversity and on the contrary, if it is less specific the safety level would be
              lowered<sup>9,10,11</sup>.

          <ul>
            <li>Our last wall is the <span class="blue-text">physical containment</span>. We decided to use the <span class="blue-text">tunnel sprayer</span>, in
              order to diffuse our product and to add some <span class="blue-text">adjuvants</span> to facilitate its use. This
              device is based on a “face to face” model in which each of the product dispenser face
              each other. It seems to be a good choice because the product that is sprayed on one
              side and doesn't end up on the plant is harvested by the panel on the other side.
              Also, it permits the deposit of the spray on both surfaces of leaves. The adjuvants
              would be a <span class="blue-text">drift limitant</span>, a <span class="blue-text">bounce and shatter minimiser</span> and a <span class="blue-text">sticker and
                retention aid</span><sup>7,8</sup>.

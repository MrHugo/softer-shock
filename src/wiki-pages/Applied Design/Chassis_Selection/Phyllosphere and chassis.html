          The plant aerial surface, of which the leaves cover most, is home to many microorganisms (archaea, bacteria, eukaryotes).
          This microbiota of the plant surface is called the phyllosphere, and it is truly fascinating because of its unique
          characteristics<sup>1</sup>. The leaves are harsh environments for life and these organisms show interesting adaptive
          properties. They are also able to interact closely to the host plant, forming what is called a holobiont.

          Learning about the phyllosphere was important for us because we wanted to know how our organism would survive on
          the surface of the leaf. We wanted to predict how the leaf will interact with its microbiota. Indeed, just like
          any other microbiota, the phyllosphere has a fragile balance and perturbing it with our organisms is the last
          thing we want. While we were studying the phyllosphere, we had the pleasure of an interview with a phyllosphere
          expert,  Dr. Corinne Vacher (you can find the interview
          <u><a href="http://2017.igem.org/wiki/images/b/b6/Ionis-paris-2017-HP-achievements-Vacher.pdf">here)</a></u>, who gave
          us a lot of information and advice.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is important to understand as much as we can about the environment we are going to work on to synergise with it
          and maximise product efficiency.
        </p>
        <p>
          The phyllosphere can be a harsh environment, particularly with respect to temperature and solar radiation. Such a
          microclimate is highly heterogeneous and makes our product difficult to engineer and model without field study<sup>2</sup>

              We have also analysed the microbial phylums of the phyllosphere (bacteria, eukaryotes, and archaea), showing a
              great variety of adaptative properties like methanol metabolism and UV stress resistance. Surviving in the environment
              of the leaf is difficult and requires some unique strategies, hence the microbial population is not homogeneously
              located on the leaves but rather on nutrient oases<sup>1,3</sup>.
              Most available nutrients of the phyllosphere are leached by-products of plant metabolism such as carbohydrates and
              methanol, so the Phyllosphere Microbial Community (PMC) could almost be compared to scavengers that live with the
              strict minimum<sup>1</sup>.
              The phyllosphere organisms can provide stimulation through hormone secretion (like auxin), and protect the host
              from pathogens by forming a physical barrier, just like our gut microbiota<sup>3</sup>.
            </p>
            <p>
              The population dynamics of phyllosphere organisms will be described, as well as how they interact with their host.
              These microbial populations are influenced by many parameters and interact with each other in the classical schemes
              of predation,commensalism,parasitism,mutualism and ammensalism. We also examined the routes of colonisation of the
              aerial parts of the plant by its microbiota at the origin (rainfall, soil…)<sup>3</sup>.

              For Softer Shock we will need a host organism, or chassis. Our strategy is to select as a chassis an organism that
              lives in the target’s phyllosphere.
              Therefore, these characteristics are very important because they could enhance the properties and effects of our
              product on the targeted plant if we choose a chassis that comes from the target’s microbiota. By selecting a bacteria
              native to the target crop’s phyllosphere we will better be able to predict its behavior and know that it can survive
              in hard conditions, and provide additional beneficial services for our product.
            </p>
            <p>
              We believe that our chassis selection could be made with metagenomics, the science of genome analysis, that permits
              to know what organisms are in a given environmental sample and what are their functions. For example, we could sample
              leaves from a vineyard, then analyse the genome of its microbial inhabitants and try to assess their functions, relying
              as well on proteomics, metabolomics and many other interesting sciences<sup>4</sup>.
              The analysis will permit us to select the most interesting organism for any vineyard and maximise efficiency and
              biosafety. We hypothesise indeed that by selecting a phyllosphere specific organism, we will reduce its impact on
              other environment such as soil and water, because it will not be adapted to them. We hence will need to analyse the
              target plant surrounding environment to choose an organism that is specific only to its phyllosphere.

          With such science, and as the phyllosphere varies with species and geographic localisation, we want to prove that we could use personalized treatment for each farmer by selecting a specific chassis for each. That way we will adapt to the farmer rather than he adapts to us. In a time of controversies raised by monopolisation of seed market by big companies, such strategy could help raise confidence from the farmers to GMOs and synthetic biology.

    <h1 class="TITRE">Working with the plant: Perspectives for chassis selection in accordance with the phyllosphere</h1>
    <p>The plant aerial surface, of which the leaves cover the most, is home to many microorganisms (archaea, bacteria, eukaryotes).</br>
      This microbiota of the plant surface has been termed the phyllosphere, and it is truly fascinating ! </br>
      The leaves are harsh environments for life and these organisms show some interesting adaptive properties and are also able to interact closely to the host plant, forming what is called a holobiont.</br>
      Getting interested into the phyllosphere was important for us because we want to know how our sprayed organism will survive at the surface of the leaf and try to predict how it will interact with its microbiota. Indeed, just like any other microbiota, the phyllosphere has a fragile balance and perturbing it with our organisms is the least thing we want !</br>
      We also would like to choose the Softer Shock chassis based on the phyllosphere organisms, as they are very interesting and adapted to plant leaves ! Such choice could influence the biosafety of our product and many other of its characteristics, but we must be very careful about what we want for the project !</br>
      Find out more details and explore the microbial jungle with us in the following report !</br>

    <p>Out of my jungle ! And what a jungle ! In this report we described the harsh environment  of the leaf microclimate (the phylloclimate) and to what stresses is the phyllosphere subjected to, from UV to temperature. Such microclimate is highly heterogeneous and makes our product difficult to engineer and modelize without field study, but recent studies of modelisation seem to provide hopes ! We did some planet exploration metaphores here. See this report as a preliminary work that explorers would do before landing on a planet. It is crucial to understand everything of the environment you are going to work with to synergise with it and maximise the product effect.</br>

      We analysed the microbial phylums of the phyllosphere (bacteria, eukaryotes, archaea), showing a great variety and adaptative properties like methanol metabolism and UV stress resistance ! Surviving on the deserts that are leaves is very complex and requires some unique strategies, hence the microbial population is not homogeneously located on the leaves but rather on nutrient oasis.
      The nutrients of the phyllosphere are most of the time leaching by-products of plant metabolism such as carbohydrates and methanol, so the Phyllosphere Microbial Community (PMC) could almost be seen as scavengers that live with the strict minimum !</br>

      The dynamic of the population of the phyllosphere organisms was also analysed as well as how they interact with their host. These microbial populations are influenced by many parameters and interact with each other with the classical scheme of predation/commensalism/parasitism/mutualism/ammensalism. We also examined the routes of colonisation of the aerial part of the plant by its microbiota at the origin (rainfall, soil…).</br>

      The phyllosphere organisms can provide stimulation through hormone secretion (like auxin), and protect the host from pathogens by forming a physical barrier, just like our gut microbiota.
      These properties are very important because they could enhance the durability of our product on the targeted plant if we choose a chassis that comes from the target’s microbiota. Indeed, by selecting for example a bacteria of the phyllosphere, we will be able to predict its behavior, and know that it can survive in such hard conditions, and provide additional beneficial services for our product.
      Finally we showed that our chassis selection could be made with metagenomics, the science of genome analysis, that permits to know what species are in a given sample. For example, you sample leaves from a vineyard, then analyse the genome of its microbial inhabitants and try to assess their functions, relying as well on proteomics, metabolomics and many other interesting sciences.
      With such science, and as the phyllosphere varies with species and geographic localisation, we proved that we could use personalized treatment for each farmer by selecting a specific chassis for each ! That way we will adapt to the farmer rather than he adapts to us. In a time when controversies raised by monopolisation of seed market by big companies, such strategy could help raise confidence from the farmers to GMOs and synthetic biology.</br>

      Spread the word around you: there are millions of organisms on leaves and they are awesome ! They just need more attention...

    <h1 class="TITRE">Case Study - Frostban</h1>
    <p>Frostban was a product engineered by the company Advanced Genetic Sciences in the 80’s. The product relied on the use of Genetically Modified bacteria (P.Syringae/P.Fluorescens) to outcompete ice nucleation on crops and decrease frost damages. This was all done on a gene coding for proteins causing Ice-nucleation from these species,called the Ice Nucleation Proteins. Such strategy is important to understand because we should like to compare it with our strategy to treat frost.</br>
      The product, although it displayed promising results, was never commercialised and had to be re-designed.</br>
      The tensions raised by the trials of Frostban and GMOs on open fields showed capital insight into whether or not society was ready for such product. Both parts of the opposition, AGS as locals and intellectuals like Mr.Jeremy Rifkin, fought hard to win their respective battle, legally or not.</br>
      We think it was important to know this case instead of choosing to ignoring it, because the past is always a great source of lessons for projects like ours. In this report we describe the product, the context of its use, and compare it with Softer Shock to show how synthetic biology and GMO product engineering have evolved in 30 years. Walk with us into the past with the next report !</br>

    <p>And we are done ! Softer Shock provided its services to Pierre, which we hope, will be satisfied for the next years to come.
    Working on the applied design of Softer Shock was very enriching but also immensely difficult, because of our lack of experience and the theoretical aspect of the project.
    What we wanted to achieve was to design the most realistic product possible with our own student’s touch of innocence and naivety.
    In our school we are future engineers, and for us this is what is engineering : integrating all the possible difficulties and opportunities in the design of an innovative solution that can help overcoming a problem. This is what we tried for the applied design of Softer Shock, and we hope you felt it as much as we did.</br>

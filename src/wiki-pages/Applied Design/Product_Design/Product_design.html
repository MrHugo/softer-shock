    <title>A Softer Shock Story</title>

    <h1 class="TITRE">Foliar Application: Nourishing and protecting from the leaves</h1>
    <p>Here we are finally. After many reports about all that we need to consider for our product, we are going to make choices and integrate everything in the next final report. But this report will be unlike any other. It is going to be a story, a real-world situation, in which a farmer, Pierre, contacts our company so we can offer him our services. From the chassis selection to the final harvest of Pierre’s wine, we are going to follow the process of Softer Shock, while detailing all that we chose for our dear product.</br>
    We sincerely hope you will enjoy the next report, remember that if something is unclear for you, all the other reports are there to answer your questions, or you can just mail us !
    Time to open the Softer Shock story !
    </p>
    <p>And we are done ! Softer Shock provided its services to Pierre, which we hope, will be satisfied for the next years to come.
    Working on the applied design of Softer Shock was very enriching but also immensely difficult, because of our lack of experience and the theoretical aspect of the project.
    What we wanted to achieve was to design the most realistic product possible with our own student’s touch of innocence and naivety.
    In our school we are future engineers, and for us this is what is engineering : integrating all the possible difficulties and opportunities in the design of an innovative solution that can help overcoming a problem. This is what we tried for the applied design of Softer Shock, and we hope you felt it as much as we did.</br>

    Thank you for reading us and having the patience to read our work.</br>

    The iGEM IONIS Team.

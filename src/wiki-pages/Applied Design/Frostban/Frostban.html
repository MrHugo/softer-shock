    <h1 class="TITRE">Case Study - Frostban: Application of GMOs on crops to prevent frost damages</h1>
    <p>Frostban was a product engineered by the company Advanced Genetic Sciences in the 80’s. The product relied on the use of Genetically Modified bacteria (P.Syringae/P.Fluorescens) to outcompete ice nucleation on crops and decrease frost damages. This was all done on a gene coding for proteins causing Ice-nucleation from these species,called the Ice Nucleation Proteins. Such strategy is important to understand because we should like to compare it with our strategy to treat frost.</br>
      The product, although it displayed promising results, was never commercialised and had to be re-designed.</br>
      The tensions raised by the trials of Frostban and GMOs on open fields showed capital insight into whether or not society was ready for such product. Both parts of the opposition, AGS as locals and intellectuals like Mr.Jeremy Rifkin, fought hard to win their respective battle, legally or not.</br>
      We think it was important to know this case instead of choosing to ignoring it, because the past is always a great source of lessons for projects like ours. In this report we describe the product, the context of its use, and compare it with Softer Shock to show how synthetic biology and GMO product engineering have evolved in 30 years. Walk with us into the past with the next report !</br>

    <p>We hope you understand now why we wanted to know Frostban and why it was important to try to compare it to our project. The controversies led my rule violation both by AGS and local opponent shows that no part is truly wrong or right and that such project can be led to its end only by means of respect and discussion as well as education.
      Learning about Frostban was really enriching because it can teach us a lot of lessons.</br>

      We furthermore had the chance to contact one of the academic scientist implied in the discovery of the interest of the Ice Nucleation Protein gene, Mr.Steven Lindow, to have his feeling about the situation.  His opinion was overall that the negative reception of GMO spray was due to the fact that a small very opposing minority was highlighted by the media, and that most of the population, without being for or against GMOs, was most likely to not see their benefits if they were not obvious. This is why developing Frostban, which was not beneficial directly for the population, was difficult. We should face the same problems with Softer Shock.</br>

      Field test results however showed that the product was efficient, reducing on average 20% of the freezing damages done to targeted plants, and that the unwanted dissemination of the GMOs was nevertheless possible in the surrounding environment. The accidental spreading of the organisms was most likely due to drift, a phenomenon that we want to master the best way possible through containment measures (see our “Biosafety report).  Note however that the organisms seemed to decay over time but that the evaluation was done with ancient material and technics. It could be interesting to retry such field tests with the methods we have nowadays (maybe with Softer SHock, who knows?).</br>

      This dissemination was judged non-problematic by the Environmental Protection Agency (USA) as toxicity tests had been provided showing no damages from the organisms to humans (at least). That also shows the relevance of toxicity and ecotoxicity tests, as they can provide support from governmental organisms. Overall studying Frostban highlighted all the aspects of our applied design and why we are doing these reports.</br>

      It was very great to try to compare Softer Shock with Frostban because it showed really nice insight into how GMOs and synthetic biology have evolved during the last 30 years and how we anticipate them. The symbol of such anticipation is the killswitch mechanisms that have recently emerged, as well as synthetic auxotrophy. Scientists around the world, with lessons from projects like Frostban, can hence work on making better products and contain GMOs in the best way. Maybe with the coming years more mechanisms will be created, and society might accept synthetic biology as a part of itself, if it is correctly done and iif the people are correctly informed.</br>

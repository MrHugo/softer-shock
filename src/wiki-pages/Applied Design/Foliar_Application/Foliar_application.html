    <h1 class="TITRE">Foliar Application: Nourishing and protecting from the leaves</h1>
    <p>Softer Shock is all about the spray, whether of microorganisms or of compounds like we mentioned in our entrepreneuriat part. Understanding the anatomy of our principal target, the leaf, is hence primordial.</br>
      Sprays are all subjected to many parameters, from temperature to humidity and pH, and acknowledging them is very important to maximise the efficiency of our product.</br>
      Furthermore, if we wish to spray microorganisms, it is crucial to know how they are usually applied on crops as biopesticides and biostimulants to engineer our product the best way. All these points are discussed in the following report ! May the cuticle be with you !

    <p>In this report we showed that leaves had complex anatomy with many organs and points of entry (cuticle, lenticels, trichomes, stomata, hydathodes). These points of entry morphology and repartition varies highly according to species so it is important to know well the plant species your are working with.</br>
      Spraying compounds on these organs imply to take into account numerous parameters, whether from the spray itself (concentration of the active ingredient, solubility, molecular weight, pH of the spray, adjuvants) or the surrounding environment (cuticle composition, number of points of entry, leaf topography, leaf age, canopy, light intensity, temperature and humidity). All these points show how difficult but no less interesting it is to design an efficient spray.</br>
      We also studied the different benefits of using microorganisms as stimulants and pesticides (less environmental impact, targeted activity, quick decomposition as compared to classical compounds and regulation by plant and its microbiota). There is of course to make for Softer Shock between spraying microorganisms and spraying non-living compounds like we mention in the entreprenariat part, but this shows that both side have their advantages and problematics.</br>
      Also was mentioned the different formulations for microorganisms spray, from wettable powder to encapsulation, which might be what we will be choosing for Softer Shock ! Encapsulation will provide greater safety for our organism once on the target plant during the time it develops using the synthetic amino acid (see our Biosafety report) we provided it.</br>
      We will very likely add adjuvants to our spray, as they are interesting compounds that enhance spray activity and limit the process of drifting. Drifting is the derivation of the spray from his initial target because of the effect of external factors such as wind.</br>
      This phenomenon is important to master because it induces loss of product and of course contamination of the surrounding environment due to our microorganism. Adjuvants must however not interact with the organism and the target itself so they must be chosen carefully.</br>
      The goal here is to obtain a spray that is easy to apply, provide a great environment for the organism during and after the application, and is the most realistic possible. That was the main goal of this report, showing all the parameters to integrate them in our final product design (see “Final Engineering and application”).</br>

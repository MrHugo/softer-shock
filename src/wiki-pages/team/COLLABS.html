         </ul>
            <p># marge Our collaboration started on August the 28th. One of our team members went to Japan for holidays and met the Tokyo Tech team. They presented their projects and due to the high similarity between their last project “SnowWhite” and our project, they proposed to do a lab & model collaboration. They sent us their BioBrick pCOLD and we performed new characterizations to improve their part registry, and gave them our model handbook preview to use for their iGEM project.
            Working with the Tokyo team was an amazing adventure and allowed us to fulfil one of the Silver medal criteria.</p>
            <p>- Thank you Tokyo Tech team, it was a pleasure to work with you !</p>

            <p><li>Protein expression by OD measurements & kinetics and the establishment of the program SimRNA</li></p>
            </ul>
             <p># marge Our collaboration started in August.The iGEM Bettencourt kindly provided us with awesome devices to measure fluorescence so we could characterize the expression of our proteins at different temperatures the best way! As we were not familiar with such methods, they explained and advised us very greatly. Without them we would have relied only on colorimetric measurements and could not have improved the characterization of the iGEM Tokyo part which relies on GFP.
             For their project, they needed to model their RNA organelle strands. We helped them for the establishment of the program “simRNA” and gave them some tips to use it by themselves.
             Besides, we provided them the preview of our model handbook to allow them to do molecules animations for their project.</p>
             <p>- A warm thanks to all of them !</p>

             <ul>
             <p><li>Model a sequence using our software tools & GMOS ‘S regulation in France</li></p>
             </ul>
              <p># marge Our collaboration with the team Chihuahua started on the 10th of July. We first did a skype to present teams and projects.
              They were interested in our model part, so we offered them our help using our model softwares to get a clearer view about the possible interactions of their enzymes together.
              In order to do so, we used the website Phyre2 to model the only sequence not present in the PBD register: yhiH

              We tested the sequence during all July. Using Phyre2, the molecule was modeled with high reliability and corresponding to other existing close models.
              Using Pymol, we studied the molecule’s identity matching.

              We provided a document about the French regulation to help them with their Human project to develop a new law for GMOs regulation in Mexico.

              They helped us to build our interactive map, providing us information about synthetic biology in their country and spreading two of our surveys: the first one to their society to understand the society’s GMO perception, and the second one was for their winemakers in Chihuahua.
              They organised a skype with a winemaker, in which we had the chance to interact directly with her and talk about climate disorder, how it affects their vineyards and know their opinion on using SofterShock as a potential solution.

              The results from the collaboration were very satisfactory: their sequence was very likely to be the one obtained by experimentation, we obtained several feedbacks from the society and winemakers, and they had extra elements to write a new law for Mexico.</p>
              <p>- Besides good friends, the collaboration with IONIS team brought us some improvements in our project, mainly in our modeling. The IONIS modeling team helped us to visualize one of our enzymes: “yhjH”. Based on bibliography and the enzyme optimal conditions, they managed to simulate it in silico, helping us to establish and assume model parameters and enzyme behaviors, among other things. We hoped we helped you as much as you did, thank you so much!” -<span class="blue-text">Team Tec-Chihuahua</span></p>

              <p><li>GMOs‘s regulation in France</li></p>
              </ul>
               <p># marge Our collaboration with the team Valencia_UPV started in August. We discussed about our projects over a Skype on the 3rd of August. Due to the different application areas, it was complicated to set up an experimental or model collaboration, but we could help each other on our Human Practices projects.

               We asked them to inform local winemakers and viticulturists about our project and get their opinion on our project’s potential impact using the survey we created. They contacted three winemakers from Utiel-Requena (Valencia) and La Rioja; they presented our project Softer Shock and asked them their opinion.  See feedbacks here LINK (to our wiki).

               On our side, we answered to the few questions they had to complete their Human Practices project.
               These questions helped them to have an overview about how their project will be seen in other countries depending on the regulation.</p>

               <p>- The collaboration has helped us to define a part of our Human Practices. We wanted to know the social opinion about GMO crops and the current situation about their human consumption in each part of the world. That's important for us because our project depends on it social acceptation. -<span class="blue-text">Team Valencia_UPV</span></p>

               <p><li>Bioethics & Synthetic Biology opinion by experts</li></p>
               </ul>
                <p># marge Our collaboration with Team Greece began with a mutual interest in our projects, which we discussed over a Skype call on October 16. Due to the completely different application areas there was little room for an experimental or model collaboration, but we could help each other on our Human Practices projects.

                We asked them to inform local winemakers and viticulturists about our project and get their opinion on our project’s potential impact using the survey we created. They contacted three winemakers from Krini and Trikala and another from Thessaloniki (Greece); they presented our project Softer Shock and asked them their opinion.  See feedbacks here LINK (to our wiki).

                On our side, we presented their project “pANDORRA” to some of our human practices contacts and forwarded their surveys, one to bioethics experts and regulators and another to synthetic biology experts.
                These surveys helped them get an overview of how regulation linked to their project works in France and also to have information about synthetic biology related to their project from French experts.

                We want to thank all the teams that have supported us and have given us more information about the effects of climate change in their countries, in order to study the impact that Softer Shock may have around the world.</p>

                <p>- We’re very glad to have come across team IONIS. IONIS provided us with a missing link on our human practices campaign OSIRIS: opinions from regulators. Thanks, IONIS! -<span class="blue-text">Team GREECE</span></p>

                 <p> # marge We participated in the iGEM Toronto podcast project! The goal was to answer their questions so they can give an overview on many different projects with the mean of an audio recording. We had to describe our project, how we came up with the idea, and what would be the perspectives for both our project and synthetic biology.</p>

                  <p> # marge We participated to the translation of several projects from other teams in French (KU Leuven, Moscow_RF, Tec Chihuahua, UChile_OpenBio-CeBiB and XMU-CHINA).
                  The goal was to help the team Leuven to inform everyone about what is iGEM and what the students achieve during this competition in different languages and be accessible to everyone. It is also a great way for them to get in touch with synthetic biology and genetic manipulations, something that is currently held back and limited due to negative perceptions by the masses.<p>

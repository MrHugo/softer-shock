          <div class="colored-container">
            <p># marge This year, as was done the two last years, we have formed a multidisciplinary team made of 20 members from different IONIS schools (EPITA, E art Sup and Sup ‘Biotech). We have had many adventures working together and we have especially discovered our group skills under rush moments. Our advisors, instructors and followers have guided and helped us when we needed it. We would like to thank our iGEM mentor Mr Selvarajah for his pieces of advice and for helping us understanding the iGEM submissions. The team PARIS IONIS was responsible for most of the iGEM adventure functioning: fundraising, ordering supplies, laboratory experiments, background and applied research, designing the project, finding sponsors and partnerships, organizing events, team organization and project communication among the society. The help of our advisors, instructors and mentors was very appreciated and acknowledged below.</p>

They listened to our project, they gave us advice about the safety part regarding GMOs and they suggested us to be careful about the leave phyllosphere because it is very complex and it will be difficult for us to choose a specific chassis to work with. They advised us to quantify the dead vines each year due to frosts and compare to the number of surviving vines in order to have a better estimation of what our product can bring.
               We thank Mr. Kempf for the marketing advice about how to position our solution Softer Shock in the market and Mrs Garrigues for her clear opinion about Softer Shock “very clear strategic side, but we must work hardly on the environmental GMOs’ controversy".</p>

				<h2>Overview</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>This year, communicating with industries and engaging with the general population was the cornerstone of our human practices. On this page, you will see what we did and our achievements for the silver and gold medal.

				<h2>Public outreach</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>One of our major objectives was to sensitize students to synthetic biology in high schools. We presented different applications in many domains and we asked them to play a game to create their own biological tool to answer a problematic. We also participate to several events such as the iGEM week, “La fête de la science” and two iGEM meetups to promote our project. This page, will show you what we did on public communication and ethic reflexion about Softer Shock.

				<h2>Society, law and GMOs</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>In this tab, you will see our innovative approach to inform the population thought an interactive map that gathers information about GMOs all around the world. Moreover, we wanted to be as close as we can to the reality concerning the industry on plants protection. Consequently, we met many experts in the regulation, plant protections or climate changes to answer at all our issues concerning Softer Shock.

				<h2>Perspectives</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>We want to continue doing scientific vulgarisation for the iGEM competition. After meeting EuropaBio, we found a partnership to communicate about synthetic biology and its activities concerning green biotechnologies. In this tab, you will see our collaboration.

            <h2 class="marged">WHAT DID WE DO?</h2>
            <h3>Public Outreach for the Silver medal </h3>
            <hr>
            <div class="row">
              <div class="col-md-6">
                <p> Human practices is just as important as the scientific aspect because
                  communication and agreement of people is crucial for the acceptance of new
                  technologies. In order to achieve our goals and
                  <span class="blue-text">promote synthetic biology</span>, we organized
                  <span class="blue-text">events, meetups, lectures</span> and
                  <span class="blue-text">talks</span> with different people in our society.
                </p>
                <p>Raising awareness among younger students can sometimes be hard! We wanted to
                  show that our world is full of biotechnology, whether it be in health, agri-food
                  or cosmetics. Therefore our team designed an original, innovative and fun card
                  game to be used for next iGEM IONIS generations. This game allows students to put
                  themselves in the shoes of a scientific engineer, like an iGEM participant!
                </p>
              </div>
              <div class="col-md-6">
                <p>Because engaging with the general public is so important, we created two surveys
                  and translated them into several languages such as Spanish, German, Arabic, Chinese,
                  and others with the help of friends and relatives. The first was aimed at consumers
                  in order to obtain a large collection of data concerning the
                  <span class="blue-text">public perception of GMOs</span> as well as social
                  acceptance of SofterShock.  The second was sent to the farmers (winemakers) to obtain
                  information about <span class="blue-text">climate change</span> in their
                  geographical area and also their <span class="blue-text">opinion</span> about SofterShock.

            <h3>Society, Law and Regulation for the Gold medal</h3>

            <div class="row">
              <div class="col-md-6">
                <p> <span class="blue-text">The right perception</span> of GMOs is a key issue today
                  in many countries. That’s why we discussed with several experts and iGEM teams about
                  GMO controversies. We also tried to find  the correct way to <span class="blue-text">educate</span>
                  the population.
                </p>
                <p>This year, our team created an innovative and original integrated human practices work.

                <div class="col-md-6">
                  <p>
                    We are developing an <span class="blue-text">interactive map </span>to
                    <span class="blue-text"> visualize social perception of GMOs, regulations,
                      and research news</span>. We wish to bring new information the greater public,
                      allowing them to rebuild their own opinion about GMOs. We also wish to help
                      <span class="blue-text">future iGEM teams</span> to know more about the current
                      status of GMOs all around the world.

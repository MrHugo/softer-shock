            With no surprise, we found out that our “Softer Shock” product might struggle to find its place in France.

          <p>
            Several results support this conclusion: firstly, 78% of the population think
            GMOs are not safe for the environment. Secondly, 144 out of 219 people (65.75%) were
            concerned by the eventual presence of GMOs in agriculture or environment.

            from harsh temperatures.

            To balance the previous results, Mexico is more moderated regarding population opinion.

            These 3 analysis give us a precise vision of the public opinion in the concerned countries.
            Regarding our interactive map, the objective was to work on different fields for 6 countries
            (USA, Taïwan, Spain, France, Mexico and Brazil). However, the lack of answers for 3 of them
            do not allow us to show representative results.
            From the public opinion follows the creation of laws and regulation of the country.

    and scientific researchers adapt their work to their country regulation. Click on the

                        <hr>

                        <p> We wanted to understand how society perceive GMOs in the world and where our project Softer Shock will be more suitable to be develop. Our goal is to share and communicate a maximum of information to know how GMOs work around the world in an attractive, objective and funny way. The map was designed with the help of iGEM teams through surveys (go to “Dialogue and Education” to see the survey analysis) to respond to society’s need for information and to be open source to everyone (researchers, entrepreneurs, iGEM teams, and the general public).
                        </p>

                        <p>The first step to creating these surveys was to identify the key issues through a review of current sources of information on GMOs addressed to the general public. The second step was to translate the survey into several languages with the help of friends and family and distribute it around the world.
                        </p>

                        <p>Several iGEM teams helped us to distribute the surveys in their country. Thanks to them we collected answers from all over the world and got more than 100 responses from key countries such as Mexico, France, Spain, and Brazil. We used these four countries to gauge the major needs of a society with respect to GMOs and develop a general approach for other countries.
                        </p>

                        <p> The results also reflect the historical and current-events context in health, environment, and agriculture sectors, as well as reactions of regulations and safety directives in place in these countries.
                        </p>

                        <p>We reviewed the GMO safety and application regulations in 6 countries: Spain, France, Mexico, Brazil, China, and USA. We didn’t analyse the surveys for China, USA, and Spain because there were not enough answers. We also reviewed the current state of GMO deployment in these countries.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                          The online interactive map collects and displays the results of our international GMO survey about. The website was made with Bootstrap, JavaScript, and JQuery, while the map itself is displayed using D3.js.

                        <p>
                          The smooth slide scrolling effects were achieved using the One Page Scroll library, and all animations are pure CSS.

                        <p>Working on these countries allowed us to be in a direct contact with their iGEM teams. Some of these countries also encountered problems from climate change that affects vineyards in Mexico, Spain and Greece (which is not yet represented on the map).
                        </p>

                        <p>They spoke with us by Skype and distributed our survey among the winemakers in order to understand how they deal with climate change and introduce Softer Shock as a potential solution. Most of them gave advice for French vineyards on which techniques should be used. To find out more go to “Dialogue with Experts”.

                            <p> We met Mr Tarnovsky, CEO of Swiper. As he has valuable knowledge about websites and data, we organized a meeting during the summer. </p>

                            <p> The idea of the interactive map was discussed and what we needed to do so it becomes a valuable tool that can help a lot of people. The aspects highlighted were the importance and the ways to get data. It was advised to build a prototype of the map so we could assess the behaviour of the user. it was suggested that the prototype must contain a limited amount of countries such as the one belonging to the G20 group.Datas must be collected from the prototype so that the project can answer to the visitor’s need. In order to get those datas, the prototype would display a restricted amount of information and the website would be fully accessible only when the survey is filled. This ensure the degree of data filling. Other ways include offering visibility and advertising from partners.</p>

They also help us to place our project in a GMO category for the society security.</p>
                            <p> To finish, they encourage us to continue to be engage with farmers and consumers  because they will helps us to integrate SofterShock in the society.

                              <p> The goal of this interview was to understand the main climate changes affecting the vineyard in France. We discussed about the dangers of cold temperature and also how winemakers can reduce the impact of frost with the help of particular devices.</p>
                              <p> This year, the frost during the spring resulted in a loss of 70% of the grapevines in the region of Bordeaux and a loss of 25% in Champagne. Several techniques to counter these losses are used by professionals in this sector. However it is often expensive and water consuming.</p>

                              <p class="marged">At the end of the meeting, Mr Pauthier offers to us the possibility to do some experimentation in their institution. If the proof of concept is successful, a partnership will be done between the iGEM Paris Ionis team and the Comité Champagne in order to perform some tests in the field.</p>

                              <p> The goal of this interview was to understand the main climate changes affecting the vineyard in France and more specifically the south of  France affected by very hot summer.

                              <p> Mrs Leplatre think that our project is a good idea because global warming affecting the vineyards are the problem of the year. It was the first time that the south of the France has suffered from frost. There has been 10 % to 15% less production this year because of hail, frost or drought.</p>
                              <p> As long as your product has no impact on health, she sees no inconvenience in advising the vine growers to use this solution on their vineyards. She also give us some advice with on our product. If our solution are working on the vine it will be necessary to irrigate the vineyard in addition because the soil will be dry too and it will be not enough to have only our solution.</p>

Unfortunately they weren’t able to finance the project due to the company image in France but in exchange they put us in contact with several experts in the French Agriculture regulation like the ANSES and the contact of someone in the United States GMO regulation.</p>
                              <p>It was a very pleasant experience, to talk to professionals in the plant care, have their opinion about SofterShock and share scientific knowledge. We certainly developed our professional communication skills!</p>

We also re-think about the real interest for farmers to have a thermo-sensitive and autonomous system.</p>

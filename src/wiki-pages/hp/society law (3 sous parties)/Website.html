		   <h2> Objectives </h2>
		   <hr>
		   
           <p> We wanted to understand how society perceive GMOs in the world and where our project Softer Shock will be more suitable to be develop. Our goal is to share and communicate a maximum of information to know how GMOs work around the world in an attractive, objective and funny way. The map was designed with the help of iGEM teams through surveys (go to “Dialogue and Education” to see the survey analysis) to respond to society’s need for information and to be open source to everyone (researchers, entrepreneurs, iGEM teams, and the general public).
		   </p>
		   
           <p>The first step to creating these surveys was to identify the key issues through a review of current sources of information on GMOs addressed to the general public. The second step was to translate the survey into several languages with the help of friends and family and distribute it around the world. 
		   </p>
		  
		   <p>Several iGEM teams helped us to distribute the surveys in their country. Thanks to them we collected answers from all over the world and got more than 100 responses from key countries such as Mexico, France, Spain, and Brazil. We used these four countries to gauge the major needs of a society with respect to GMOs and develop a general approach for other countries.
		   </p>
		  
		   <p> The results also reflect the historical and current-events context in health, environment, and agriculture sectors, as well as reactions of regulations and safety directives in place in these countries. 
		   </p>
		  
		   <p>We reviewed the GMO safety and application regulations in 6 countries: Spain, France, Mexico, Brazil, China, and USA. We didn’t analyse the surveys for China, USA, and Spain because there were not enough answers. We also reviewed the current state of GMO deployment in these countries.

		   <h3> How was the interactive map coded ?</h3>
		   
		   <br></br>
		   <h2>A few words from our computer engineer:</h2>
		   <hr>
		   
		   <p>The online interactive map collects and displays the results of our international GMO survey about. The website was made with Bootstrap, JavaScript, and JQuery, while the map itself is displayed using D3.js.
		   </p>
		  
		   <p>The smooth slide scrolling effects were achieved using the One Page Scroll library, and all animations are pure CSS.
		   </p>

		   <p>Working on these countries allowed us to be in a direct contact with their iGEM teams. Some of these countries also encountered problems from climate change that affects vineyards in Mexico, Spain and Greece (which is not yet represented on the map).
		   </p>
		   
		   <p>They spoke with us by Skype and distributed our survey among the winemakers in order to understand how they deal with climate change and introduce Softer Shock as a potential solution. Most of them gave advice for French vineyards on which techniques should be used. To find out more go to “Dialogue with Experts”.

    <p> We are looking for information  to answer  major problems found by the already existing websites on GMOs. We want to make our platform <b> active and attractive </b> for young, researchers and curious people. Our goal will be reached when our platform will inform about: An adequate definition of GMOs, news about GMOs (the advances in each sector for each country) , a  popularized regulation of GMO and a representative opinions
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>Consequently, a target of 100 answers is expected per country for each survey to enable us to build our online platform.</p>

    <p>As said above, we selected the surveys with around 100 answers. Also, 12 out of the 23 questions were analysed to get the population opinion, to make hypothesis whether or not our project could be implemented in the country and to know if our interactive map was a special need to get more information about GMOs.

          <p> Several results support this conclusion: firstly, <b>78%</b> of the population think GMOs are <b>not safe for the environment</b>. Secondly, 144 out of 219 people (65.75%) were concerned by the eventual presence of GMOs in agriculture or environment.</p>
          <br>
          <p> And finally, <b>44%</b> of persons against the use of GMOs on crops to protect them from harsh temperatures.</p>
          <p>However, our interactive map project is in accordance with the population’s requirements. It meets the needs of 65% people that wish to develop their knowledge about GMOs. </p>

          <p> These 3 analysis give us a <b>precise vision</b> of the public opinion in the concerned countries. Regarding our interactive map, the objective was to work on <b>different fields</b> for 6 countries (USA, Taïwan, Spain, France, Mexico and Brazil). However, the lack of answers for 3 of them do not allow us to show representative results.
          </p>
          <p> From the public opinion follows the creation of <b>laws and regulation</b> of the country.

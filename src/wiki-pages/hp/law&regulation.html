		  <h2 class="marged"> Objectives </h2>
          <p> The objective of the data collection for the global regulation of GMO is to 
		  complete our interactive map. Also, we want to compare how GMOs are perceived by 
		  the government in different countries around the word and how they put into effect the regulation. 
		  </p>
		  
		  <h2 class="marged">Intended audience  </h2>
          <p>The public for the regulation of our project are mainly the population that want 
		  to discover easily the GMOs’ regulation of their country or in another one. This part 
		  can be useful to the future IGEM teams or for scientific researchers too, to see all 
		  the regulatory requirements to start a project in a country.
		  </p>
		  
		  <h2 class="marged"> Data collect </h2>
		  <p>To collect data for all countries, we consult: </p>
		  <ul> 
			<li>International Organism website (Food and Agriculture Organization of the 
			United Nation, International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-biotech Applications, …)</li>
			<li>National Organism website (United State Department of Agriculture, 
			the Library of Congress, …)</li>
			<li>National government website</li>
			<li>the Law of the country</li>
			<li>We asked IGEM team in the country for more information</li>
		  </ul>
		  
		  <h2 class="marged"> The Regulation </h2>
		  <p>Here are below the data collected about GMO's regulation from 6 countries: Brazil, 
		  China, France, Mexico, Spain, United States.</p>
		  
		  <p><span class="blue-text">Brazil</span></p>
		  <p>Brazil is an open-minded country about the development of GMOs, despite 
		  a strict law to limit the spreading of GMOs in the environment Brazil is one 
		  of the major producer and exporter of GMO crops. Although, consumption of 
		  genetically modified crops is legal the product need to be labeled as transgenic.<sup>1</sup> 
		  </br>Besides, to protect the environment of the propagation of GMO, Brazil ratified the Cartagena 
		  Protocol on Biosafety.<sup>2</sup> An international protocol of good conduct to protect 
		  the environment.<sup>3</sup>
		  </p>
		  
		  <p>China</span></p>
		  <p>This past years, China have enacted many laws on GMOs to boost their research 
		  on biotechnology without neglect the environment and the human health. In this 
		  optic, research on GMOs are facilitate but the cultivation and the commercialization 
		  are strictly supervised. The consumption of modified crops is possible, but the 
		  product has to present a label .<sup>4, 5</sup>
		  </br>The Cartagena protocol was also ratified by China.<sup>2</sup>
		  </p>

		  <p><span class="blue-text">France</span></p>
		  <p>France has a really strict law on GMO, in addition to the European law, 
		  France enacts other laws to restrict their utilization. Due to the unfavorable 
		  opinion public opinion on the subject, there is no GMO cultivation in France 
		  except for some scientific research and the consumption of transgenic product 
		  is practically inexistent despite a flexible law on the subject.<sup>6, 7</sup>
		  </br>The Cartagena protocol was also ratified by France.<sup>2</sup>
		  </p>
		  
		  <p><span class="blue-text">Mexico</span></p>
		  <p>Mexico’s Law on GMO, privilege the right use of safety during the manipulation of it. 
		  Many reports are required on the identification, the evaluations and the strategies 
		  planned to counter the spreads of GMO in the environment. Despite this safety, Mexico 
		  produce many type of GMOs and the law for the consumption of modified crops specify that a 
		  transgenic product did not require a specific label unless special condition.<sup>8, 9</sup>
		  </br>The Cartagena protocol was also ratified by Mexico.<sup>2</sup>
		  </p>
		  
		  <p><span class="blue-text">Spain</span></p>
		  <p>Unlike France, Spain is an open-minded European country about GMOs. It is the 
		  biggest producer of GMO crops in Europe. Like France, Spain must follow the European law 
		  on GMO, but the country also enacts their own law for the research and production of GMO. 
		  In the other hand, for their consumption, Spain only follow the European recommendation.<sup>10, 11</sup>
		  </br>The Cartagena protocol was also ratified by Spain. <sup>2</sup>
		  </p>
		  
		  <p><span class="blue-text">United State</span></p>
		  <p>The United States are the biggest producer of GMO thanks to a different 
		  point of view from the society, government and economy of the country. In the 
		  United States most GMOs are considered as safe for the human health. This point 
		  of view facilitates companies and individuals to produce and consume GMO than in 
		  other countries. Indeed, GMOs are considered as a food additive by the US law and 
		  not as a biologic product.<sup>4, 12</sup>
		  </br>In this optic, the United States did not ratify the Cartagena Protocol 
		  on Biosafety to protect the environment of the propagation of GMO.<sup>2</sup>
		  </p>
		  
		  <p>During this data collect, we saw different point of view on GMOs. We only focus 
		  on 6 countries, but we want to continue filling out the interactive map to have a 
		  global overview of the different regulation in the world. Afterward, we were curious 
		  about different applications of synthetic biology on these countries and how companies 
		  and scientific researchers adapt their work to their country regulation. Click on the 
		  link to see these applications.

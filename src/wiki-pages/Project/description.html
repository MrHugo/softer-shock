        <h2>Vineyards and climate change</h3>
          <hr>
          <p> Recently displaced from its leading position among global wine producers with a 12% recession last year, France suffers from climate change and its negative impacts on vineyards. The appearance of extreme temperature events threatens the agricultural economy and farmers have to deal with the current unsatisfactory solutions. Using synthetic biology, we are developing a thermo-adaptive biological product “SofterShock” for protecting grapevines against climatic hazards.</p>

          <h2>A thermo-responsive microorganism</h2>
          <hr>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-6">
              <p>We are engineering a microorganism to make it express a specific protectant at the
                plant surface depending on the outside temperatures. Below 15°C, ice-binding proteins
                will interact with ice crystals to either inhibit their growth (antifreeze proteins)
                or favoring the nucleation process (ice-nucleation proteins). Despite their opposite
                functions, both strategies could be of great help to prevent frost damages in their
                own way and small-scale tests are required to make a final choice. Above 37°C,
                light-reflecting compounds will limit evapotranspiration by creating a reflective layer.
                Once applied on crops, our solution will possess a double protection: anti-drought and anti-frost.

              <p>This solution is used as a spray which contains our engineered bacteria. This idea
                raised some questions such as: which organism should we use ? Which compounds are the
                best for foliar protection ? How do we ensure biosafety in a limited area but still open
                environment ? How we can evaluate toxicity ? How should the spray be composed and how
                can we optimise its application on target ? All these aspects have been discussed in our
                Applied Design part.

        <h2>Use of chromoproteins</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>As a proof of concept, the specific compounds will first be chromoproteins (amilCP and mRFP), in order to induce a simple visual response by our plasmid. The bacteria should produce two distinct colors according to the temperatures : red in response to heat and blue in response to cold. Finally, we will test the function of both plasmids together in the same host cell by a double transformation.
          Our strategy concerning the Cold Shock response is to use the cold-induced cspA promoter system. The molecular components are the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The cold shock response sequence itself, which is composed of  an UP element  Promoter, our 5’UTR and a DSBox</li>
          <li>Chromoprotein (amilCP) : it is the reporter</li>
      </ul>

        <p>Our strategy for the heat is to  use the heat-shock response system in order to express red proteins at high temperatures. The molecular components are the following :</p>
        <ul>
          <li>pL promoter, also called lambda left promoter, and which is used with cI857. At 30 degrees, the repressors binds to the promoter and prevents its actions. At 42 degrees, the protein cI857 falls off the promoter because of too much molecular vibrations, so the promoter can allow transcription.</li>
          <li>cI857 regulation system</li>
          <li>Chromoprotein (mRFP) : it is the reporter</li>
      </ul>
        <h2>Molecular modeling</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Molecular modeling is a key part of this project. It was used to predictively design regulatory sequence modifications appearing in the coding sequence (the DS Box of the otherwise untranslated cspA 5’UTR). It was also used to characterize the structure of the cspA 5’UTR and propose an explanation for its function in the formation of the ribosomal pre-initiation complex at low temperatures.</p>

              Firstly, other crops could benefit from the Softer Shock technology according to their physiological
              properties and geographic location. When discussing with Mexican wine-growers, they mentioned the high
              temperature gaps existing between hot and cold seasons. In this context, having a this dual protective
              solution could be of great interest for farmers.

          <div class="col-md-4" style="margin-top: 60px">
            <p>
              We can even go further and think about more “futuristic”
              approaches. Direct genetic modification of plants with a dual thermo-responsive plasmid could allow them
              to become more resistant to temperatures stresses and brutal climatic changes. Therefore, those plants may
              be grown in extreme environments where few crops are grown today, and even maybe on other planets !

		<h4>Thermal time calculation for monitoring plant development</h4>
		<p>
		  Plants “record” daily average temperature and store it in a total cumulated sum called “thermal time”. As soon as the needed thermal time is reached, the plant can go to the next stage of development. Thermosensible bacteria could be transformed to irreversibly express a red pigment over a precise temperature. A red “gradient” would then be visible as a function of the heat recorded over time. Alternatively, we could use the bacteria to record the average temperature every day, by comparing the color obtained to a reference scale of colors (like pH paper). Being able to visualize thermal time could be useful to predict crop development in a particular location or back-calculate the best sowing date.

		  The Softer Shock micro-organisms could also be useful in other fields than agriculture.

        <h4>Self-regulation of solutions</h4>
        <p>
          Solution thermoregulation can be costly for industrials or scientific researchers. What could be interesting is to make the thermo-responsive bacteria respectively induce an exothermic reaction as the temperatures decrease, in order to reheat the medium, or an endothermic reaction as the temperatures increase in order to cool it down.

              The interesting thermo-reactiveness activity can find valuable functions in controlled drug delivery.
              Tumoral or inflammatory microenvironments are characterized by an higher temperature compared to the rest of the body.

              Encapsulated inside vectors, the micro-organisms could react to temperature increases by releasing a compound to
              destroy the surface and liberate the active principle locally.

              As you may know, all food products subjected to a freezing process should never be frozen again after thawing.
              It is particularly hard for individuals, but also industrials, to guarantee that this “cold chain” has not been broken.
              Thanks to the Softer Shock technology, we could elaborate an irreversible system allowing an easy and visual indicator

              microbiological sticker for the same objective. Improving this technology by optimizing the temperature changes detection
              could be an interesting research axis for Softer Shock.

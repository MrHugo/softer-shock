    <h1 class="TITRE">Introduction</h1>
    <p class= "intro">Our ultimate goal in Softer Shock is to protect vineyards from extreme temperature events by applying a microorganism on their leaves. This apparently simple task actually faces a great number of difficulties and needs to integrate different sciences to obtain a concrete and efficient product. The goal of this part is to show you what was our reasoning with such a project and make you understand all of its facets. Here you will find various parts that are all completed by a report available for all. The final and last report will integrate all the others and present you the final product. Have fun !</p>

    <h1 class="display-3">Foliar application : protecting and nourishing from the leaves</h1>
    <p class=" lead">The main target of Softer Shock are the grapevine leaves. Many applications of products, from nutrient sprays to biocontrol, need to take in account various parameters to maximise their efficiency. But can you really nourish and protect a plant from the leaves?  What are the parameters to take into account to maximise a spray efficiency? How are microorganisms sprayed on leaves ? Find out the answers to these questions in the following report !

    <h1 class="display-3">Working with the plant: perspectives for chassis selection in accordance with the phyllosphere
    </h1>
    <p class="lead">For our project, we want a specific chassis for a great number of reasons. The leaf ecosystem is a harsh environment on which a great number of organisms live and survive ! They have awesome adaptive properties and their population is shaped by a lot of dynamics. Our goal here is to understand this environment and its inhabitants to predict the best way how our microorganisms will behave once applied. We thought that selecting a chassis based on the leaf surface microbiota called the phyllosphere, could help into improving efficiency and safety of Softer Shock ! Find out everything you need about the incredible phyllosphere and our chassis selection strategy in the next report !

    </h1>
    <p class="lead">Frost and desiccation are our enemies, and against them we have a great number of weapons ! To fight both, different strategies have been offered to us, from antifreeze proteins to sunlight reflecting compounds. We based ourselves on the complex grapevine physiology in response to meteorological events, but also on previous concrete cases of attempts to fight the resulting damages. Find out what compounds we chose and how our organism will operate in the next report !

    </h1>
    <p class="lead">We are going to spread genetically modified organisms on crops in an open environment. This idea itself makes our project difficult and exposed to many objections. While we are aware of the risks Softer Shock implies, we tried our best to maximise the biosafety of our project through a great number of strategies, from synthetic auxotrophy to harvesting panels. Find out our biosafety strategy in the next report !

    </h1>
    <p class="lead">Our goal is to protect grapevine and the French wine, a great part of our countryâ€™s identity. French wines are of course directly linked to consumers (like you and I) and the environment. We wanted hence to evaluate the toxicity of our product for the potential consumers if it was to be used. Find out out our toxicology and ecotoxicology study in the next report !
